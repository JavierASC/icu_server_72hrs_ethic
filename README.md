# Predictive Model for Early ICU Mortality using Machine Learning: An Integrated Approach to Bioethics and Decision-Support System

This is a study focused on **bioethics**, discussing the potential benefits of a **decision-support system** that helps clinicians to admit or not a patient in the ICU, and to remain a patient in the ICU or not.

These decisions are made in order to optimize **patients' end-of-life care**, and **healthcare resources** based on the probabilities of a patient to expire within the first 72 hours after ICU admission.

For this aim, we developed three data windows corresponding to three different machine learning-based models (i.e., *random forests*) to make these mortality predictions.
